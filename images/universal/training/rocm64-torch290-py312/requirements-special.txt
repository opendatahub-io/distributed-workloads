# Special packages requiring --no-build-isolation
# 
# These packages are in a separate file because they:
# 1. Cannot be resolved in pylock.toml (need ROCm/HIP at compile time)
# 2. Need to be prefetched for Konflux hermetic builds
# 3. Must be installed with special flags in the Dockerfile
#
# Installation:
# flash-attn needs --no-build-isolation --no-deps
# GPU_ARCHS must be set for ROCm builds (e.g., gfx90a;gfx942)
