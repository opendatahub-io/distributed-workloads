# Special packages requiring --no-build-isolation
# 
# These packages are in a separate file because they:
# 1. Cannot be resolved in pylock.toml (need CUDA at compile time)
# 2. Need to be prefetched for Konflux hermetic builds
# 3. Must be installed with special flags in the Dockerfile
#
# Installation order matters:
# 1. flash-attn (standalone, needs --no-build-isolation --no-deps)
# 2. causal-conv1d (first, needs --no-build-isolation)
# 3. mamba-ssm (second, needs --no-build-isolation --no-deps)

flash-attn==2.8.3
causal-conv1d==1.5.3.post1
