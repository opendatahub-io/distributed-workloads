# KubeRay quickstart

There is a demo notebook in the tutorial directory that you can run to get started with KubeRay. It will walk you through the process of setting up a cluster and running a simple example.

## Setup

You can follow the instructions in the [base readme](../README.md) to install the Distributed Workolads stack.

## Notebook

At this point you should be able to go to your notebook spawner page and select your notebook image of choice.

You can access the spawner page through the Open Data Hub dashboard. The default route should be `https://odh-dashboard-<your ODH namespace>.apps.<your cluster's uri>`. Once you are on your dashboard, you can select "Launch application" on the Jupyter application. This will take you to your notebook spawner page. After that, simply upload the notebook and ray cluster template from the tutorial directory and you should be good to go.
