# Running Tests Manually

Manually running tests requires use of the the [opendatahub-io/peak](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/peak) project.

## Prerequisites

* Admin access to an OpenShift cluster ([CRC](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) is fine)

* Mac users may need to do the following:

```bash
brew install coreutils
ln -s /usr/local/bin/greadlink /usr/local/bin/readlink
```

* NOTE: The tests appear to be flaky when running from mac. Running from linux is actually the recommended way to run them.

* If you run these tests in a local cluster and have not deployed the Open Data Hub on your OpenShift cluster:

```bash
# Install CodeFlare operator
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads/main/tests/resources/codeflare-subscription.yaml

installPlanName=$(oc get installplans -n openshift-operators -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.ownerReferences[0].name=="codeflare-operator")].metadata.name}')
oc patch installplan $installPlanName -n openshift-operators --type merge -p '{"spec":{"approved":true}}'

# Install ODH operator and wait for the deploy/opendatahub-operator-controller-manager in the openshift-operators namespace to become available
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads/main/tests/resources/odh-subscription.yaml

# Deploy Open Data Hub core components
oc new-project opendatahub
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/master/kfdef/odh-core.yaml -n opendatahub

# Deploy CodeFlare stack
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads/main/codeflare-stack-kfdef.yaml
```

## Bash tests - Setup

Clone the [opendatahub-io/peak](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/peak) project anywhere you like in your working environment. But, do not clone it into the `distributed-workloads` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/peak
cd peak
```

Then we need to update the peak project with its submodule dependencies. Specifically, [opendatahub-io/openshift-test-kit](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/openshift-test-kit/tree/0e469c4bf967b531780eb05d6b96463214288db7) defined in the `.gitmodules` file.

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Now we need to pull our `distributed workloads` project into the peak repo for testing. This is done by creating a file, `my-list`, that contains the repository name you want to use, the channel, the repo's location (this can be a github url or a relative path to a local directory) and branch name.

For example, if you cloned peak into the same directory level as `distributed-workloads`, then you would create a file, `my-list`, in the following way:

```bash
echo distributed-workloads nil ../distributed-workloads main > my-list
```

Now we can setup our tests.

```bash
./setup.sh -t my-list
```

This should create a directory, `distributed-workloads` in the `operator-tests` directory of the peak repo.

## Bash tests - Running Tests

`run.sh` will search through the 'operator-tests' directory for a *.sh file name we provide to it as an argument. In this case, we want to run the `distributed-workloads.sh` script.

```bash
./run.sh distributed-workloads.sh
```

If everything is working correctly you should see an output similar to the below:

```bash
Running example test

Running operator-tests/distributed-workloads/tests/basictests/distributed-workloads.sh:15: executing 'oc project opendatahub' expecting success...

```

In some cases, your cluster may not have the default user+password(admin, admin) combination on it. In those situations, you can manually pass in a custom user and password by running tests as below:

```bash
OPENSHIFT_TESTUSER_NAME=<user_name> OPENSHIFT_TESTUSER_PASS=<password> ./run.sh distributed-workloads.sh
```

## Go tests - Setup

* Install Go 1.20

## Go tests - Environment variables

* `ODH_NAMESPACE` - Namespace where ODH is installed
* `CODEFLARE_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` - Output directory for test logs

## Go tests - Running Tests

Execute tests like standard Go unit tests.

```bash
go test -v ./integration
```

## Troubleshooting

If any of the above is unclear or you run into any problems, please open an issue in the [opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/distributed-workloads/issues) repository.
