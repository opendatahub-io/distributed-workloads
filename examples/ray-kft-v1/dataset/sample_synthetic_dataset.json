      "question": "During a school fundraiser, Sarah sold 36 cupcakes on Monday. On Tuesday, she sold twice as many cupcakes as she did on Monday. How many cupcakes did Sarah sell in total over these two days?",
      "answer": "Step-by-step solution: Step 1: Calculate the number of cupcakes sold on Tuesday. Since she sold twice as many cupcakes on Tuesday compared to Monday, we multiply the number of cupcakes sold on Monday by 2. \\( \\text{Cupcakes sold on Tuesday} = 36 \\times 2 \\). Step 2: Add the number of cupcakes sold on both days to find the total. Sum up the cupcakes sold on Monday (\\(36\\)) and Tuesday (result from Step 1) to get the total.",
