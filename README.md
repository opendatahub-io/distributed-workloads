# distributed-workloads
Artifacts for installing the Distributed Workloads stack as part of ODH

## Overview

Distributed Workloads is a simple, user-friendly abstraction for scaling,
queuing and resource management of distributed AI/ML and Python workloads.
It consists of three components: 

* [CodeFlare SDK](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk) for controlling remote Ray clusters through any Python based environment
* [Multi-Cluster Application Dispatcher (MCAD)](https://github.com/project-codeflare/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher) for management of batch jobs
* [Instascale](https://github.com/project-codeflare/instascale) for on-demand scaling of a Kubernetes cluster

Intrgration of this stack into the Open Data Hub is owned by the Distributed Workloads Working
Group. See [this page](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-community/tree/master/wg-distributed-workloads)
for further details and how to get in touch.
